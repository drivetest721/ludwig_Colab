How many bytes are there in a kilobyte?

### Input:


### Response:
","There are 1024 bytes in a kilobyte.

However, the term kilobyte has historically been used to refer to either 1024 bytes, or 1000 bytes, depending on the context. In the International System of Units (SI), the prefix ""kilo"" means 1000, so 1 kilobyte (kB) would be 1000 bytes. However, in the context of computing and data storage, where binary data is organized in powers of 2, it has been common to use a different set of binary prefixes, where 1 kibibyte (KiB) = 1024 bytes. 

Since approximately 2000 the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has developed an international standard of binary prefixes, they include prefixes: kibi-, mebi-, gibi-, tebi-, pebi-, and exbi-, so growing in factors of (2^10). However, even now kilobyte interchangeably is used to mean 1024 bytes, while in contexts such as data transmission and consumer storage, often is used","nobody################rual
